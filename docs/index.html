           Across India, many university students balance their studies with family expectations and personal goals. While this dedication often leads to academic success, our research shows it may also impact mental wellbeing. From bustling Mumbai campuses to quiet study halls in Bangalore, students share similar struggles beneath their academic achievements. The pressure to perform excellently in exams, secure competitive internships, and meet family expectations creates a complex emotional landscape many navigate alone. What's particularly concerning is that these challenges often remain invisible until they manifest as serious mental health issues, with our data revealing that over 60% of surveyed students report symptoms of depression â€“ a silent crisis unfolding in lecture halls and dormitories across the nation. In cities like Kalyan, Srinagar, and Mumbai, young adults pursuing degrees engage in a delicate balancing act between achieving academic excellence and maintaining their psychological health, often prioritizing the former at the expense of the latter. The narrative of success in Indian society continues to be primarily measured through academic accomplishments and career prospects, creating an environment where mental wellbeing becomes secondary to obtaining high CGPA scores and prestigious placements.
        </p>

        <p>
          In India's educational environment, students work hard to achieve good grades. However, their mental health needs often receive less attention. Our investigation draws from responses of nearly 28,000 university students across the country, creating one of the most comprehensive portraits of student wellbeing to date. The analysis delves into the complex interplay of 18 different factorsâ€”from sleep duration and academic performance to family history and social connections. This rich dataset reveals compelling patterns: how sleep deficits under 5 hours correlate with higher depression rates, how academic pressure manifests differently across regions from Mumbai to Srinagar, and how family history intertwines with current mental states. What emerges is a nuanced understanding that challenges simplistic views of student depression, suggesting that meaningful change requires both personal support systems and structural reforms in how educational success is defined and pursued in Indian society. The findings paint a concerning picture where CGPA scores in the 5.5-9.5 range often mask underlying emotional struggles, where gender differences reveal unique vulnerabilities for both male and female students, and where regional variations highlight the impact of cultural and environmental factors on mental health outcomes. By examining these interconnected variables, we've created a roadmap for understanding not just who experiences depression, but why certain students are more vulnerable, what protective factors might exist, and how interventions might be better targeted to address the specific needs of different student populations across India's diverse educational landscape.

        <p>
          We chose this topic because student mental health is an important
          issue that needs more attention. Our data shows that more than 60% of
          students reported symptoms of depression. As students ourselves, we
          understand these challenges and wanted to create visualizations that
          help explain the different factors affecting mental health in
          educational settings.

            Our analysis uses the
            <a
              href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset"
              >Student Depression Dataset</a
            >
            from Kaggle. This dataset includes information about students'
            mental health, academic performance (CGPA), lifestyle habits (sleep
            patterns, social media usage), demographics (age, gender), and other
            mental health indicators (suicidal thoughts, family history of
            mental illness). Through our visualizations, we aim to show the
            human story behind the statistics and help identify warning signs of
            depression among students.

        <h3>Understanding Our Data</h3>

        <p>
          Before creating visualizations, we wanted to understand what our
          dataset really represents. Each row in our data shows one student's
          life - their sleep habits, stress levels, and mental health. Each
          number tells part of a story about nearly 28,000 university students
          across India. Like most real-world data, these needed to be prepared
          carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dataset had no missing values, which is unusual and helpful.
          However, many columns had long labels and text responses instead of
          numbers. To make the data easier to analyze while keeping its meaning
          intact, we made several improvements.
        </p>

        <div class="article-highlight">
          <h4>How We Prepared the Data</h4>
          <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
            <li>
              <strong>Making column names simpler:</strong> We changed long
              names like <em>"Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?"</em> to
              shorter ones like <code>Suicidal_Thoughts</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Converting text to numbers:</strong> Yes/No answers became
              1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No." We did this for columns like
              <code>Suicidal_Thoughts</code> and <code>Family_History</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating numerical scales:</strong> For categories like
              <code>Financial_Stress</code>, we used numbers (Low = 1, Medium =
              2, High = 3) to make comparisons easier.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standardizing time measurements:</strong> Sleep
              descriptions like "5â€“6 hours" became numeric values (5 hours) for
              consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating separate columns for categories:</strong>
              Variables like <code>Gender</code> and
              <code>Profession</code> were split into multiple yes/no columns
              for better analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          These changes made the dataset much easier to work with, allowing us
          to better explore how different aspects of student life relate to
          mental health.

        <h2>Depression and Life Risk Among Students</h2>

        <p>
         Mental health struggles among university students often remain invisible, particularly in high-pressure academic environments. While many institutions track depression rates, this single measure fails to capture the true extent of student suffering. Recent studies reveal a more complex reality when examining additional factors like suicidal thoughts alongside depression symptoms. This multi-dimensional approach helps distinguish between moderate concerns and high-risk cases, illuminating the severity of psychological distress that many students silently endure.

        </figcaption>
      </div>     

        <p>
          These findings shows a concerning picture. Half of all students we surveyed are experiencing both depression and thoughts of suicide, putting them at high risk. Only about 4 in 10 students reported feeling mentally healthy, while the rest experience various levels of distress. To make this more concrete, imagine a classroom with 40 students, and about 20 of them might be silently battling serious mental health challenges that could affect their entire future. Most concerning is that many of these students continue to attend classes, complete assignments, and even excel academically while carrying this heavy invisible burden.
       </p>
       <p>  
        This does not just affect individual wellbeing, it impacts the quality and reliability of essential services all Indians depend on.  The high-risk individuals shown in the visualization will become tomorrow's doctors, engineers, teachers, and business leaders throughout the country. When half of these professionals enter their careers with unaddressed mental health challenges, it raises serious questions about workplace safety, productivity, and India's innovation potential in an increasingly competitive global landscape. Furthermore,  moderate risk (depression without suicidal thoughts) represent an opportunity for early intervention that is currently being missed. The stark division shown in the data, where less than half of students report no depression symptoms which challenges the notion that mental distress is rare or isolated among Indian youth. Instead, it suggests a systemic issue requiring institutional responses across India's educational and social framework rather than just individual solutions.

        <h2>What Influences Student Mental Health?</h2>
        <p>
          Several factors affect student mental health, from daily habits to
          academic pressures. In this section, we explore how different aspects
          of student life relate to depression, revealing potential risk factors
          and protective measures.

          We invite you to explore the interactive visualization above. It shows
          how different factors in a student's life connect to their mental
          health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at the data this way reveals clear patterns. For example, we
          found that longer work or study hours link to higher depression rates.
          For each additional hour of work, depression likelihood increases by
          about 5% until reaching 9 hours, where it remains consistently high.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interestingly, we also found that students who report no academic
          pressure actually have a higher chance of depression than those with
          low academic pressure. This suggests that some level of academic
          engagement may be beneficial for mental health.

          <h3>The Strongest Connections</h3>
          <p>
            While our interactive visualization shows trends for each factor, we
            wanted to know which factors have the strongest link to depression.
            We used statistical measures including Cramer's V and point-biserial
            correlation to find out. The results are shown below.

            The chart shows that <strong>academic pressure</strong> has the
            strongest connection to depression, followed by
            <strong>financial stress</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Diet and Sleep: Critical Lifestyle Factors</h3>
        <p>
          While academic pressures and financial concerns represent external stressors in student life, we wanted to understand how daily lifestyle choices might influence mental health outcomes. Among these, diet and sleep patterns emerged as particularly significant factors that students can often modify, even when facing unchangeable pressures like academic demands or financial constraints.
        </p>
        <p> 
          The chart below visualizes the relationship between diet quality, sleep duration, and depression risk among Indian university students:

          </figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>
          The results reveal a striking pattern. Students with unhealthy diets who sleep less than 5 hours face the highest depression risk (0.76), while those with healthy diets sleeping more than 8 hours show the lowest risk (0.37), a remarkable 50% reduction. Even when diet quality remains constant, increasing sleep duration consistently lowers depression risk across all categories. Similarly, improving diet quality while maintaining the same sleep duration reduces depression risk substantially. Most notably, these lifestyle factors appear to have a compounding effect, with the combination of healthy diet and adequate sleep offering the strongest protection against depression.
        </p>

        <p>
          These findings have profound implications for Indian society, where academic excellence is often prioritized at the expense of basic health needs. The data suggests that a significant portion of student mental health problems could be addressed through relatively simple lifestyle interventions that don't require expensive medical treatment or therapy. For educational institutions, this presents a cost-effective approach to improving student wellbeing through campus food options, schedule adjustments that allow for proper sleep, and education about healthy living. At a national level, addressing these factors could help preserve India's greatest asset - the mental capital of its young professionals who will drive future economic growth and innovation. When nearly half of students suffer from preventable mental health issues, the economic and social costs extend far beyond campus boundaries.

          <h3>Other Important Factors</h3>
          <p>
            While academic and financial stress show the strongest links to
            depression, we also found that <strong>sleep patterns</strong> and
            <strong>dietary habits</strong> play important roles. These are
            areas where students might have more control, offering potential
            ways to improve mental wellbeing even in demanding academic
            environments. CGPA score show very weak correlation with depression,
            suggesting that academic performance alone doesn't determine mental
            health.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Our analysis of the Student Depression Dataset reveals a complex
          picture of mental health among Indian university students. The data
          shows that over 60% of students report experiencing depression
          symptoms, with academic pressure and financial stress being the most
          significant risk factors. Other important factors include sleep
          patterns, dietary habits, and family history of mental illness.
          Regional patterns also emerge, with higher depression rates in urban
          areas. This suggests that the university environment, including
          academic demands and living conditions, plays a crucial role in
          student mental health. Those insight can help universities, students,
          and families better understand and address mental health challenges.

        <h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Based on our data analysis, we suggest several approaches that could
          help address mental health issues among Indian students. These
          recommendations are for different groups in the education system.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>For Educational Institutions</h3>
          <p>
            Universities and colleges should make mental health a priority by
            creating accessible support services and awareness programs. Since
            poor sleep links strongly to depression, institutions could review
            assignment schedules and exam timings to allow for healthier sleep
            patterns. Adding stress management and emotional resilience training
            to the curriculum could provide students with practical coping
            skills.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>For Students</h3>
          <p>
            Getting enough sleep appears especially important for mental health,
            with our data showing much lower depression rates among students who
            sleep 7-8 hours regularly. Limiting social media use and building
            supportive friendships also links to better mental health. Students
            should learn to recognize early signs of depression and seek help
            early, as this can prevent more serious problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>For Parents and Families</h3>
          <p>
            Families play an important role in supporting student mental health.
            Our data suggests that high parental expectations about grades may
            contribute to depression in some cases. Parents should keep
            communication open about mental health, learn to recognize warning
            signs, and balance academic goals with overall wellbeing. Creating a
            home environment where students feel comfortable discussing mental
            health challenges helps ensure they get support when needed.
