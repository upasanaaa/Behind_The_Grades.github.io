     <h2>Beneath the Surface of Academic Excellence</h2>
     
     <p>
       Every morning across India, millions of students wake up before dawn. They study into the night, compete fiercely for top grades, and bear the weight of their families' expectations. But behind the celebrated success stories of India's educational system lies a troubling reality that few are willing to discuss.
     </p>
     
     <p>
       In India's competitive educational environment, students face immense pressure to excel academically. While their achievements are celebrated, the mental health challenges they face often remain hidden. Our project examines data from nearly 28,000 university students across India to understand the scope of this silent crisis and identify factors that contribute to student depression.
     </p>
     
     <div class="article-quote">
       "When we see high-achieving students, we often miss the psychological cost they're paying for that success."
     </div>
     
     <p>
       We chose to focus on this issue because student mental health represents an urgent yet frequently overlooked problem. With more than 60% of students in our dataset reporting depression symptoms, there's a clear need to shed light on the struggles that exist beneath the surface of academic achievement. As students ourselves, we connect with these challenges and wanted to create visualizations that help others understand the complex factors influencing mental wellbeing in educational settings.

       <h3>About This Project</h3>
       <p>
         Our analysis uses the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset" >Student Depression Dataset</a> from Kaggle, which includes comprehensive information about students' mental health status, academic performance (CGPA), lifestyle habits (sleep patterns, social media usage), demographics (age, gender), and other mental health indicators (suicidal thoughts, family history of mental illness). Through interactive visualizations, we aim to tell a human story that goes beyond statistics and helps identify warning signs and risk factors for depression among students.
       </p>
     </div>
   </section>

   <section id="dataset" class="visualization-section">
    <h3>Behind the Numbers: Understanding Our Data</h3>
  
    <p>
      Before diving into visualizations and statistics, we wanted to understand the human experiences captured in our dataset. Each row represents a student's life - their sleep patterns, stress levels, and mental state. Each number tells part of a larger story about nearly 28,000 university students across India. But like any real-world data, these stories needed careful handling to be told accurately.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Fortunately, the dataset had no missing values, which is remarkably rare in survey data. Still, several columns contained long or inconsistent labels, and many responses were written as words instead of numbers. To make the dataset easier to work with while preserving the human experiences it represents, we performed a series of preprocessing steps.
    </p>
  
    <div class="article-highlight">
      <h4>How We Prepared the Data</h4>
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Simplifying column names:</strong> Long labels like <em>"Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?"</em> were renamed to something more manageable, like <code>Suicidal_Thoughts</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Turning words into numbers:</strong> Yes/No answers were converted into binary format — 1 for "Yes," 0 for "No." This was applied to columns like <code>Suicidal_Thoughts</code> and <code>Family_History</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Ranking stress levels:</strong> Ordered categories such as <code>Financial_Stress</code> were encoded numerically — Low = 1, Medium = 2, High = 3 — so we could compare stress levels more meaningfully.</li>
        <li><strong>Making time measurable:</strong> Sleep duration categories like "5–6 hours" or "Less than 5 hours" were mapped to estimated numeric values (e.g., 5 or 4 hours) for consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>One-hot encoding:</strong> Variables like <code>Gender</code> and <code>Profession</code> were split into multiple binary columns so they could be analyzed without assuming any order or hierarchy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <p>
      These changes made the dataset much cleaner, allowing us to explore the relationships between stress, lifestyle, and mental health in a more precise way - and ultimately to better tell the stories behind the numbers.

       <p>
         More than 60% of surveyed students report experiencing depression symptoms, a figure significantly higher than in the general population. This widespread prevalence suggests that the academic environment may create unique pressures that affect mental health.

       <h3>Education Level Analysis</h3>
       <p>
         Depression rates vary significantly across different education levels. Undergraduate students show particularly high rates of depression, possibly reflecting the challenges of transitioning to university life and coping with new academic expectations. The visualization above allows us to compare depression prevalence across education levels, helping identify when students might be most vulnerable.

     <h2>Behind the Statistics: What Drives Student Depression?</h2>
     <p>
       Multiple factors influence student mental health, from lifestyle choices to academic pressures. 
       In this section, we explore how various aspects of student life correlate with depression, providing insights into potential risk factors and protective measures.

      We invite you to explore the interactive visualization above. It allows you to see how different factors in a student's life connect to their mental health outcomes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Looking at the data this way reveals important patterns. For instance, we can clearly see how increasing workloads correlate with higher rates of depression. With each additional hour of work, the likelihood of depression increases by roughly 5% until reaching the 9-hour mark, where the rate stabilizes at a consistently high level.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Interestingly, the data also reveals a counterintuitive finding: students who report no academic pressure actually have a higher chance of depression than those with low levels of academic pressure. This suggests that some engagement with academics may be protective, but only up to a point.
    </p>
    
    <div class="visualization-description">
      <h3>The Strongest Connections</h3>
      <p>
        While the interactive visualization shows depression trends for each category, we wanted to know which factors are most strongly linked to depression. To find out, we tested the correlation between each factor and depression rates using statistical methods including Cramer's V and point-biserial correlation. The results are shown in the chart below.

       <h3>Beyond the Obvious</h3>
       <p>
         While financial and academic stress show the strongest correlation with depression, we also found that <strong>sleep patterns</strong> and <strong>dietary habits</strong> play crucial roles. These are factors that students might have more direct control over in their daily lives, offering potential pathways for improving mental wellbeing even within high-pressure academic environments.
       </p>

     <h3>The Combined Impact of Diet and Family History</h3>
     <p>
       Our analysis revealed a particularly striking relationship between dietary habits, family history of mental illness, and depression severity. The chart below illustrates this connection clearly:

     </div>
     
     <p>
       The data tells a compelling story: students with both unhealthy diets and a family history of mental illness show the highest depression risk scores (0.73). Even with no family history, unhealthy dietary habits are associated with elevated depression risk (0.68). This suggests that while genetic factors play a role, lifestyle choices remain significant.
     </p>
     
     <p>
       Perhaps most encouragingly, the data shows that healthy dietary habits appear to provide a protective effect even for students with a family history of mental illness, with risk scores significantly lower (0.48) than those with poor diets. This finding offers a tangible intervention point for students concerned about their mental health.

     <h2>The Geography of Distress: Mapping Depression Across India</h2>
     <p>
      Where you study may significantly affect how you feel. To explore this dimension, we mapped depression rates across Indian cities using our survey data. Each dot on the map represents a city, 
      colored from green to dark red depending on how many students reported symptoms of depression. The darker red the circle, the more students reported suicidal thoughts from that location.

       <p>
        The results paint a striking picture of mental health across the country. In many large cities, the rate of depression among students appears worryingly high. In some urban centers, more than half of the surveyed students reported signs of depression.
       </p>
       
       <p>
        While this map doesn't explain <em>why</em> students are struggling, it provides valuable geographic insights. Cities with more stressful environments—whether due to cost of living, academic competition, or lack of support systems—tend to show deeper shades of red on our map.

        As you explore the map, invisible patterns start to emerge. These aren't just data points—they represent thousands of young people who bear immense pressure to perform but are rarely asked about their wellbeing.

     <h2>Turning Insights Into Action</h2>
     <p>
       Based on our analysis of the data, we propose several evidence-based approaches that could help address the mental health crisis among Indian students. These recommendations target different stakeholders in the educational ecosystem.

     <div class="highlight-box">
       <h3>For Educational Institutions</h3>
       <p>
         Universities and colleges should prioritize mental health by establishing accessible support services and creating awareness programs. Considering the correlation between sleep deprivation and depression, institutions might benefit from reviewing assignment schedules and exam timings to allow for healthier sleep patterns. Additionally, incorporating stress management and emotional resilience into the curriculum could provide students with practical coping skills.
       </p>
     </div>
     
     <div class="highlight-box">
       <h3>For Students</h3>
       <p>
         Maintaining healthy sleep habits appears crucial for mental wellbeing, with our data showing significantly lower depression rates among students who sleep 7-8 hours regularly. Limiting social media usage and building supportive social connections also correlates with better mental health outcomes. Students should be encouraged to recognize early signs of depression and seek help promptly, as early intervention can prevent more serious mental health issues.
       </p>
     </div>
     
     <div class="highlight-box">
       <h3>For Parents and Families</h3>
       <p>
         Families play a crucial role in supporting student mental health. Our data suggests that high parental expectations regarding academic performance may contribute to depression in some cases. Parents should be encouraged to maintain open communication about mental health issues, recognize warning signs, and prioritize overall wellbeing alongside academic achievement. Creating home environments where students feel comfortable discussing mental health challenges can help ensure timely support.
