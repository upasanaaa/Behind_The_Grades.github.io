           Across India, many university students balance their studies with family expectations and personal goals. While this dedication often leads to academic success, our investigation shows it may also impact mental wellbeing. From busy campuses to quiet study halls, students share similar struggles beneath their academic achievements, with over 60% of surveyed students reporting symptoms of depression, a concerning reality that often remains invisible until it becomes severe. The pressure to perform excellently in exams, secure competitive internships, and meet family expectations creates a complex emotional landscape many navigate alone.
        </p>

        <p>
           Our comprehensive analysis spans nearly 28,000 students across diverse institutions, from the bustling campuses of Mumbai to the historic halls of Delhi. By examining 18 distinct factors including sleep patterns, academic workload, and family dynamics, we've uncovered revealing trends that transcend institutional boundaries. Engineering students frequently describe overwhelming pressure from technical demands and competition, while humanities students face unique but equally significant challenges. Gender differences emerged clearly: young women typically seek support during difficult periods, while young men tend to withdraw into isolation. These insights form the foundation for our proposed framework that reimagines academic success, one that balances achievement with wellbeing across India's varied educational communities.

              >Student Depression Dataset</a
            >
            from Kaggle. This dataset includes information about students'
            mental health, academic performance (CGPA), lifestyle habits (sleep
            patterns, social media usage), demographics (age, gender), and other
            mental health indicators (suicidal thoughts, family history of
            mental illness). Through our visualizations, we aim to show the
            human story behind the statistics and help identify warning signs of
            depression among students.

        <h3>A Look Behind the Numbers</h3>
      
        <p>
          Behind every data point in our study is a student with a unique story, someone balancing deadlines, exams, friendships, family expectations, and uncertain futures. With nearly 28,000 responses collected from across India, the datadoesn’t just reflect numbers; it captures lived experiences. And while no dataset can fully convey what it feels like to lie awake at night from anxiety, or to show up to class while mentally exhausted, patterns begin to appear when thousands of students speak together.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The students who responded to this survey came from all over the country, from large cities like Mumbai and Delhi to smaller towns scattered across India’s educational landscape. Their responses create a rich mosaic of modern student life: when they sleep, how they eat, whether they feel supported at home, and how often they feel overwhelmed. It allows us to examine not only how widespread mental health challenges are, but also who is most affected, and under what conditions.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          But before we could begin interpreting what these patterns meant, we needed to understand the bigger picture. Who took this survey? Are they representative of India's university population? What kinds of stressors or supports do they report? The following charts helped us orient in terms of perspective.             It begins with understanding the people behind the responses, their ages, their backgrounds, and how many of them are quietly struggling beneath the surface.

                Almost equal number of male and female students participating in the survey. This balance ensures that our findings aren’t biased by an overrepresentation of one gender. It also enables us to look more closely at how gender identity might influence how students experience depression, stress, and coping strategies. Nowadays men often face stigma for seeking emotional help and women may be overburdened by layered expectations.

                Most students in the survey fall between the ages of 19 and 25, the years when young adults become adult. This stage is marked by high academic pressure, career planning, identity development and emotional shifts. The data reflects the psychological effects that higher education can do during some of the most formative years of a students' life.

        <h2>Depression and Life Risk Among Students</h2>

        <p>
         Mental health struggles among university students often remain invisible, particularly in high-pressure academic environments. While many institutions track depression rates, this single measure fails to capture the true extent of student suffering. Recent studies reveal a more complex reality when examining additional factors like suicidal thoughts alongside depression symptoms. This multi-dimensional approach helps distinguish between moderate concerns and high-risk cases, illuminating the severity of psychological distress that many students silently endure.

      </div>     

        <p>
          These findings shows a concerning picture. Half of all students we surveyed are experiencing both depression and thoughts of suicide, putting them at high risk. To understand this more concrete, imagine a classroom with 40 students, and about 20 of them might be silently battling serious mental health challenges that could affect their entire future. Most concerning is that many of these students continue to attend classes, complete assignments, and even excel academically while carrying this heavy invisible burden.
       </p>
       <p>  
        This does not just affect individual wellbeing, it impacts the quality and reliability of essential services all Indians depend on.  The high-risk individuals shown in the visualization will become tomorrow's doctors, engineers, teachers, and business leaders throughout the country. When half of these professionals enter their careers with unaddressed mental health challenges, it raises serious questions about workplace safety, productivity, and India's innovation potential in an increasingly competitive global landscape. Furthermore,  moderate risk (depression without suicidal thoughts) represent an opportunity for early intervention that is currently being missed. The stark division shown in the data, where less than half of students report no depression symptoms which challenges the notion that mental distress is rare or isolated among Indian youth. Instead, it suggests a systemic issue requiring institutional responses across India's educational and social framework rather than just individual solutions.

        <h2>What Influences Student Mental Health?</h2>
        <p>
          Several factors affect student mental health, from daily habits to
          academic pressures. In this section, we explore how different aspects
          of student life relate to depression, revealing potential risk factors
          and protective measures.

          We invite you to explore the interactive visualization above. It shows
          how different factors in a student's life connect to their mental
          health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at the data this way reveals clear patterns. For example, we
          found that longer work or study hours link to higher depression rates.
          For each additional hour of work, depression likelihood increases by
          about 5% until reaching 9 hours, where it remains consistently high.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interestingly, we also found that students who report no academic
          pressure actually have a higher chance of depression than those with
          low academic pressure. This suggests that some level of academic
          engagement may be beneficial for mental health.

          <h3>The Strongest Connections</h3>
          <p>
            While our interactive visualization shows trends for each factor, we
            wanted to know which factors have the strongest link to depression.
            We used statistical measures including Cramer's V and point-biserial
            correlation to find out. The results are shown below.

            The chart shows that <strong>academic pressure</strong> has the

        <h3>Diet and Sleep: Critical Lifestyle Factors</h3>
        <p>
          While academic pressures and financial concerns represent external stressors in student life, we wanted to understand how daily lifestyle choices might influence mental health outcomes. Among these, diet and sleep patterns emerged as particularly significant factors that students can often modify, even when facing unchangeable pressures like academic demands or financial constraints.
        <p> 
          The chart below visualizes the relationship between diet quality, sleep duration, and depression risk among Indian university students:

        </div>

        <p>
          The results show a clear connection between lifestyle choices and mental health. Students with poor diets and minimal sleep face nearly twice the depression risk compared to those with healthy diets and adequate rest. Improving either factor alone helps significantly, but the combination provides the strongest protection. Our analysis reveals this relationship holds true regardless of academic program or financial situation.

        <p>
          These findings offer practical applications for universities. Simple interventions like improved campus dining options, education about sleep hygiene, and schedule adjustments could significantly reduce depression rates among students. While mental health is complex, addressing these basic physical needs represents a cost-effective starting point that could benefit India's educational institutions and preserve the wellbeing of future professionals.

          <h3>Other Important Factors</h3>
          <p>
            While our dataset provides valuable insights, several additional factors likely influence student mental health that weren't captured in our research. Cultural expectations and identity pressures may significantly impact students' emotional wellbeing. Economic disparities in access to mental health resources could create invisible barriers to support. Climate anxiety and concerns about future opportunities in an uncertain world may contribute to stress. The quality of faculty-student relationships and mentorship could serve as protective factors. Additionally, undiagnosed learning differences or health conditions might create added challenges. We encourage educational institutions to consider these dimensions when developing comprehensive support systems, and we welcome further research that explores these potential influences.

        <h2>Regional Patterns: Depression Across India</h2>
      
        <p>
          Where a student lives and studies can have a profound impact on their mental wellbeing. From sprawling urban campuses to quieter regional colleges, the academic experience is deeply shaped by geography. To uncover whether location plays a role in depression rates, we visualized our data on an interactive map of India, not just to show where students are, but to better understand how mental health challenges are distributed across regions.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          To make this map possible, we combined our student depression dataset with geographic information from the 
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/indian-cities-database" target="_blank">
            Indian Cities Database</a>. This publicly available dataset provided accurate latitude and longitude coordinates for hundreds of Indian cities, allowing us to match each student response with a place on the map.

            In major cities such as Ahmedabad (67.3%), Hyderabad (67.0%), and Patna (63.2%), more than 6 in 10 students reported symptoms of depression. Other large urban centers like Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Indore, and Chennai all show rates above 59%. This suggests that academic intensity, urban stressors, and cost of living pressures may be taking a significant toll on students in India's largest educational hubs.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Smaller cities and towns in the dataset shows similarity to the big cities. Even so when we focus only on cities with hundreds of students surveyed, the high prevalence remains alarming. For instance, Thane (59.1%), Meerut (59.8%), and Faridabad (58.8%) also show majority-level rates of depression.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            On the other end of the spectrum, cities like Nashik (52.8%), Jaipur (52.4%), and Kanpur (54.2%) are only slightly below the national average. Very few cities in the dataset, even those with large student populations report rates below 50%. Mumbai, often considered a highly competitive city, still shows more than half of students (55.2%) experiencing symptoms.

            While we cannot say that geography alone determines mental health, this map reveals how widespread and systemic student distress has become. These dots on the map are represent classrooms, study groups, late-night hostel conversations, and young people quietly battling pressures that often go unseen.
            If this map teaches us anything, it's that the student mental health crisis in India is not confined to any single place. It is a national issue, one that calls for national attention.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Our analysis of the Student Depression Dataset reveals a complex
          picture of mental health among Indian university students. The data
          shows that over 60% of students report experiencing depression
          symptoms, with academic pressure and financial stress being the most
          significant risk factors. Other important factors include sleep
          patterns, dietary habits, and family history of mental illness.
          Regional patterns also emerge, with higher depression rates in urban
          areas. This suggests that the university environment, including
          academic demands and living conditions, plays a crucial role in
          student mental health. Those insight can help universities, students,
          and families better understand and address mental health challenges.

          Based on our data analysis, we suggest several approaches that could
          help address mental health issues among Indian students. These
          recommendations are for different groups in the education system.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>For Educational Institutions</h3>
          <p>
            Universities and colleges should make mental health a priority by
            creating accessible support services and awareness programs. Since
            poor sleep links strongly to depression, institutions could review
            assignment schedules and exam timings to allow for healthier sleep
            patterns. Adding stress management and emotional resilience training
            to the curriculum could provide students with practical coping
            skills.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>For Students</h3>
          <p>
            Getting enough sleep appears especially important for mental health,
            with our data showing much lower depression rates among students who
            sleep 7-8 hours regularly. Limiting social media use and building
            supportive friendships also links to better mental health. Students
            should learn to recognize early signs of depression and seek help
            early, as this can prevent more serious problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>For Parents and Families</h3>
          <p>
            Families play an important role in supporting student mental health.
            Our data suggests that high parental expectations about grades may
            contribute to depression in some cases. Parents should keep
            communication open about mental health, learn to recognize warning
            signs, and balance academic goals with overall wellbeing. Creating a
            home environment where students feel comfortable discussing mental
            health challenges helps ensure they get support when needed.
