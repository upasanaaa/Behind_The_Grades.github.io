    Behind the Grades: Mental Health Trends in Indian Students
  </div>

  <p>This website explores how academic pressure, family expectations, and social dynamics influence mental health trends among Indian students. We aim to highlight the growing challenges faced by students and uncover patterns behind the statistics.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>India’s educational system is known for its rigor and competitiveness. With millions of students competing for limited seats in top colleges, stress, anxiety, and depression are increasingly common among youth.</p>

  <h2>Key Themes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Academic Pressure:</strong> High-stakes exams and performance-driven environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Parental Expectations:</strong> Influence on career choice and emotional well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Stigma:</strong> Limited mental health awareness and resources.</li>
    <li><strong>COVID-19 Impact:</strong> Increased isolation and disruption of academic routines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Statistics at a Glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 in 4 Indian students report symptoms of anxiety or depression.</li>
    <li>India has one of the highest suicide rates among youth globally.</li>
    <li>Mental health services are underutilized due to stigma and lack of access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Student Voices</h2>
  <p>“Even after scoring 95%, I felt like I failed. The pressure never stops.”</p>
  <p>“Therapy helped me cope, but I had to keep it a secret from my family.”</p>

  <h2>Call to Action</h2>
  <p>To build a healthier academic culture, we must prioritize emotional well-being. Schools, families, and policymakers need to work together to reduce pressure, normalize seeking help, and provide supportive environments for students to thrive.</p>
